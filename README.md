# List of simulations have been performed for the estimation of Renyi entropy
List of simulations by using Path Integral Ground State Monte Carlo for the estimation of Renyi entropy for N number of rotors placed in a linear chain. The inteeraction potential is modelled by dipole - dipole interactions.
 
1. Simulations already done or running for Entropy vs beta using the following parameters - 
                              
                              P = [4,8,12,16,20,24,28,32,36,40]
                              tau = 0.005
                              R = 10.05 Angstrom

                              N = 2, g = [1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0]      completed                         
                              N = 8, g = [1.0, 1.5, 2.0]                completed
                              N = 16,g = [1.0, 1.3]                     running
                              
                                                           
2. Simulations for the estimation of Renyi entropy vs g factror using the following parameters - 
                              
                              P = [4,8,12,16,20,24,28,32,36,40]
                              tau = 0.005
                              R = 10.05 Angstrom
                              
                              N = 2, g = [0.5+i*0.1 for i in range(76)] completed                         
                              N = 4, g = [0.5+i*0.1 for i in range(31)] completed
                              N = 8, g = [0.5+i*0.1 for i in range(16)] running
                              N = 16,g = [0.5+i*0.1 for i in range(11)] running
                              N = 32,g = [0.5+i*0.1 for i in range(11)] running
